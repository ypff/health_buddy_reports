This summary highlights key updates in multiple myeloma research, focusing on actionable information for patients and their families.

## 1. New Treatment Approaches

### Quadruplet Regimens

Combining proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and steroids is increasingly common for newly diagnosed myeloma. Dara-VRd (daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) is often used for transplant-eligible patients as induction therapy, potentially leading to stem cell transplantation. KRd-PACE (carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide) or similar regimens may be used in other situations. The selection of a specific quadruplet regimen is tailored to each patient, considering factors like age, overall health, genetic risk factors, and whether they are eligible for a stem cell transplant. While offering deeper remission and improved survival, these regimens can have more side effects. Discuss potential side effects with your doctor.

### Recent FDA Approvals

*   **Darzalex Faspro (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj):** FDA-approved treatment for multiple myeloma. Administered as a subcutaneous injection, it significantly reduces the time spent in the clinic for treatment. While infusion reactions can occur, they are generally less frequent and less severe compared to the intravenous formulation. Common side effects include infusion reactions like fever, chills, and cough, as well as low blood counts such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.
*   **Sarclisa (isatuximab-irfc):** FDA-approved monoclonal antibody, typically used for patients with multiple myeloma that has relapsed or is refractory to previous treatments. It is often used in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone after patients have received one or more prior lines of therapy. Discuss with your doctor to determine if Sarclisa is appropriate for your specific situation. Potential side effects include infusion reactions like nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath, and low white blood cell count (neutropenia).

### Immunotherapies (CAR-T Cell Therapy & Bispecific Antibodies)

These are generally considered for patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to multiple prior lines of standard treatments. Access to these therapies may be limited to specialized centers and require specific eligibility criteria.

*   **CAR-T cell therapy:** A highly specialized treatment considered for patients with multiple myeloma who have relapsed or are refractory after multiple prior lines of standard treatments, typically 3-4 or more. This therapy involves modifying a patient's own immune cells to attack myeloma cells. Examples include idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti). Access to CAR-T therapy requires referral to a specialized treatment center, and there may be specific eligibility criteria and a waiting period. Side effects can include Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS, managed with medications like tocilizumab and steroids) and neurotoxicity (confusion, tremors, or seizures).
*   **Bispecific antibodies:** Another form of immunotherapy used for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma after several prior lines of treatment. These antibodies work by helping your immune system target and destroy myeloma cells. Examples include teclistamab-cqvv (Tecvayli) and elranatamab-bcmm (Elrexfio). Teclistamab is administered as a subcutaneous injection, while elranatamab can be given subcutaneously or intravenously. Discuss with your doctor if bispecific antibody therapy is appropriate for your situation. Potential side effects include Cytokine Release Syndrome (similar to CAR-T) and increased risk of infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal).

**Action:** If standard treatments aren't working, discuss CAR-T or bispecific antibody therapy with your doctor early to understand eligibility requirements and if they might be an option in the future.

### Treating Smoldering Myeloma (Daratumumab)

Daratumumab is used for *high-risk* smoldering myeloma to **delay or significantly reduce the risk of** its progression to active multiple myeloma. High-risk smoldering myeloma is defined by factors like a high percentage of plasma cells in the bone marrow, high M-protein levels, and elevated serum free light chains. Resources like the IMWG criteria provide more detailed information. Discuss your individual risk level and all available treatment options with your doctor. Side effects are similar to those for active myeloma but may be less severe.

**Action:** If you have high-risk smoldering myeloma, discuss the benefits and risks of daratumumab with your doctor.

## 2. Understanding Your Blood Work

Blood tests are typically done regularly, especially during treatment, and frequency will be determined by your doctor based on your treatment phase and needs. This might range from weekly to monthly. Regular blood tests are crucial for monitoring myeloma and treatment response. Here's what to watch for:

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Monitors red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and platelets. Low neutrophils (neutropenia) can increase infection risk. Low red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue.
*   **Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP) & Serum Immunofixation Electrophoresis (SIFE):** Detects and identifies M-proteins. An increase in M-protein levels might indicate that myeloma is becoming more active, while a decrease usually indicates treatment is working.
*   **Serum Quantitative Immunoglobulins:** Measures healthy antibody levels. Myeloma can suppress the production of normal antibodies, increasing the risk of infections.
*   **Blood Chemistry Tests:** Checks organ function.
    *   **Kidney Function (BUN and creatinine):** Elevated levels might indicate kidney problems.
    *   **Calcium:** Monitors for high calcium levels.
    *   **Albumin:** Reflects overall health and nutrition.
    *   **Electrolytes:** Ensures balance.
*   **Serum free light chain (SFLC):** Detects light chains in the blood.

**Action:** Keep track of your blood test results and discuss them with your doctor at each appointment. Understand what the results mean in the context of your myeloma and treatment plan.

## 3. Managing Key Symptoms

*   **Bone Problems:**
    *   **Medications:** Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid (Zometa) or pamidronate (Aredia), and denosumab (Xgeva) are used to strengthen bones and reduce fracture risk.
    *   **Pain Management:** Pain relievers, ranging from over-the-counter options like acetaminophen or NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to stronger medications like opioids (always under careful medical supervision), physical therapy, and integrative therapies can help manage bone pain.
    *   **Orthopedic Procedures:** Vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty for fractures.
    *   **Supplements:** Calcium and Vitamin D supplements are often recommended, but it's crucial to discuss the appropriate dose with your doctor.
*   **Other Symptoms:**
    *   **Fatigue:** Regular gentle exercise, pacing activities, and good sleep hygiene can help.
    *   **Increased risk of infections (pneumonia, shingles):** Vaccinations (flu, Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 or PCV15) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV or Shingrix) is preferred over the live vaccine â€“ after consulting with your doctor), good hygiene, and avoiding close contact with sick individuals are important. Report any signs of infection (fever, cough, etc.) to your doctor promptly.
    *   **Kidney problems (decreased urine output, swelling in legs)**
    *   **Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels, increased thirst, confusion)**
    *   **Peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in hands and feet):** Management may include medications such as duloxetine (Cymbalta), gabapentin (Neurontin), or pregabalin (Lyrica), physical therapy, and supportive measures like proper foot care. If diabetes is a contributing factor, managing blood sugar is also important.
    *   **Anemia (fatigue, shortness of breath)**

**Action:** Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor promptly.

## 4. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)

MRD testing is done using highly sensitive techniques such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) or flow cytometry to detect very small numbers of myeloma cells that may remain after treatment. Achieving MRD negativity (no detectable myeloma cells) is a *goal* of treatment and is associated with better outcomes, but not always achievable. It's a *prognostic* factor (provides information about likely outcome). MRD testing is becoming increasingly integrated into myeloma management, especially in clinical trials and at specialized centers, though not yet standard everywhere.

**Action:** Ask your doctor if MRD testing is appropriate for you and how the results might influence your treatment plan.

## 5. The Growing Impact of Myeloma

With an aging population, myeloma is becoming more prevalent, emphasizing the need for research, improved treatments, and early diagnosis and awareness of myeloma symptoms to improve outcomes.

## 6. The Power of Support

Seek support from family, friends, and organizations like the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF), Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF), and Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS).

**Action:** Join a support group for emotional encouragement and practical advice. Consider professional counseling to cope with the challenges of myeloma.

## 7. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Diagnosis

AI is being explored to improve myeloma diagnosis accuracy. These systems are still under investigation and not yet standard practice.

## 8. Consider Clinical Trials

Clinical trials are crucial for advancing myeloma treatment. Discuss clinical trial options with your doctor at all stages of myeloma. You can find more information on clinicaltrials.gov or myeloma-specific trial finders from organizations like IMF or MMRF.
