## Multiple Myeloma: What's New in 2025 & What It Means For You

This report highlights the latest advancements in multiple myeloma research and what they mean for your care. New treatments are emerging, offering hope for better outcomes and improved quality of life. Here's what you need to know:

### Key Advances & Your Next Steps

*   **Cutting-Edge Therapies:** Exciting new options are available, but understanding them is key.

    *   **CAR T-cell therapy:** Supercharges your immune system to fight myeloma. Now being used in earlier lines of therapy.
        *   **Your Action:** Ask your doctor if CAR T-cell therapy is an option for you, especially if you have high-risk myeloma or myeloma outside the bone marrow. Discuss the pros, cons, and what the process involves.
    *   **Bispecific antibodies:** Bring your immune cells and myeloma cells together. Several bispecific antibodies like teclistamab (Tecvayli), talquetamab (Talvey), and elranatamab (Elrexfio) are FDA-approved.
        *   **Your Action:** If you've tried multiple treatments, discuss bispecific antibodies with your doctor. Be aware of potential side effects, like cytokine release syndrome, which is typically managed in a hospital setting.
    *   **Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs):** Deliver chemotherapy directly to myeloma cells. Belantamab mafadotin (Blenrep) is an example that targets BCMA and is re-approved with restricted use in March 2024 for specific situations.
        *   **Your Action:** Ask your doctor about ADCs and if they fit into your treatment plan, based on your history and current myeloma status.

    *   **Important Note:** These therapies can have side effects like cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity. Watch out for cytopenias, neutropenia, and infection.
    *   **Your Action:** If relevant, monitor your MRD (Minimal Residual Disease) after treatment and discuss the results with your doctor to understand their implications.

*   **Current Treatment Standards:** Quadruplet therapy is now a standard first-line treatment, like Dara-VRd (Daratumumab, Velcade [bortezomib], Revlimid [lenalidomide], Dexamethasone). Stem cell transplants and maintenance therapy with drugs like lenalidomide remain important options.
    *   **Your Action:** Talk to your doctor about the best approach for *your* specific situation, including potential side effects and how to manage them. Specifically ask about quadruplet regimens.

*   **The Power of Real-World Data:** Your experiences matter! Sharing your symptoms and concerns helps personalize your treatment.
    *   **Your Action:** Actively communicate your symptoms and quality-of-life concerns to your healthcare team. Consider participating in studies that collect patient-reported outcomes to contribute to better treatments.

### What's on the Horizon?

*   **New Targets:** Research is focused on new targets like CELMoDs (e.g., Iberdomide) and BCMA. Iberdomide is still investigational and not yet FDA-approved.
*   **MRD's Growing Role:** MRD negativity is a strong sign of good outcomes, and its role in treatment decisions is being studied.
*   **Personalized Medicine:** Genetic testing of myeloma cells is being used to tailor treatments.

### Clinical Trials: Your Opportunity

Clinical trials offer access to cutting-edge treatments.
    *   **Your Action:** Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is right for you. Search [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and [myeloma.org](https://www.myeloma.org/) to find trials.

### Questions to Ask Your Doctor

*   What are my treatment options?
*   Are there any relevant clinical trials?
*   What are the side effects, and how will they be managed?
*   What resources are available to help me?
*   How often will I be monitored?
*   What is my prognosis?
*   What does my MRD status mean for my prognosis?
*   What long-term survivorship resources are available?

**In Conclusion:**

Research continues to advance, offering hope for improved outcomes in multiple myeloma. New treatments like Daratumumab and other novel therapies are making a difference. Stay informed, communicate with your healthcare team, and actively participate in your care to achieve the best possible results.
