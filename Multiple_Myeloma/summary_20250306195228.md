## Multiple Myeloma: Your Action Plan (March 2025)

This update provides the latest advancements and actionable steps to enhance your multiple myeloma care.

### New Treatment Option: Elranatamab (Elrexfio)

*   **What is it?** Elranatamab (Elrexfio) is an immunotherapy drug, administered via injection, that empowers your immune system to target and eliminate myeloma cells. It functions by connecting immune cells directly to myeloma cells. [https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-elranatamab-eyrv-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-information-approved-drugs/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-elranatamab-eyrv-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma)
*   **Why is it important?** The FDA approved Elranatamab in 2024 for adults with myeloma that has returned or stopped responding to at least four prior treatments. It offers a new treatment avenue when other options have been exhausted. Current research aims to solidify its long-term efficacy and secure full approval. According to recent data elranatamab achieved a PFS of about 17 months and a median overall survival of 25 months in the relapsed or refractory setting.
*   **How effective is it?** Clinical trials have demonstrated positive responses in patients unresponsive to other treatments, with approximately 60% of patients showing a response in a pivotal trial.
*   **What should you know?** Side effects are possible. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), characterized by fever, chills, breathing difficulties, and low blood pressure, is a common side effect. CRS typically requires hospital management, potentially involving medications like tocilizumab or corticosteroids. Other side effects encompass infections (e.g., pneumonia, upper respiratory infections), injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), fatigue, and low blood cell counts. Neurological side effects are also possible but less frequent. Your healthcare team will closely monitor you for any adverse effects.
*   **Your Action:** If your myeloma has relapsed or is refractory (no longer responding to treatment), consult your doctor to determine if Elranatamab is a suitable treatment option.
    *   **Find out more:** A novel two-part mixture model for the incidence and time course of Cytokine Release Syndrome after Elranatamab. [https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.3533](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.3533)

### CAR T-cell Therapy: An Advanced Treatment

*   CAR T-cell therapy is a promising option for relapsed or treatment-resistant myeloma. Currently, there are two FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapies for myeloma: ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel, Carvykti) and idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, Abecma). In early 2024, both products were approved for earlier lines (ide-cel: two prior lines, cilta-cel: one prior line). This therapy modifies your own T-cells to recognize and attack myeloma cells. It is a complex treatment administered at specialized centers experienced in managing CAR T-cell therapy and its potential side effects, such as Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. The CAR T-cell therapy process spans several weeks, involving T-cell collection, lab modification, and post-infusion hospital monitoring to manage potential side effects.
*   **Your Action:** Discuss CAR T-cell therapy with your doctor if you have relapsed or refractory myeloma, and ask about potential clinical trials.

    *   **Stay Updated:** Keep abreast of the latest advancements in CAR T-cell therapy for multiple myeloma. [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/car-t-cell-therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/car-t-cell-therapy)
*   **Real world data**: Real-world data shows encouraging result for CAR T-cell therapy. Among the 248 patients enrolled in the CARTITUDE-1 trial, the overall response rate (ORR) was 95%, the CR rate was 76%, and the measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity rate was 95% for those who achieved a CR. The 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 73%.

### Minimal Residual Disease (MRD): A Key Indicator of Treatment Success

*   MRD testing quantifies the remaining myeloma cells after treatment at a microscopic level. Achieving MRD negativity, where no myeloma cells are detectable, correlates with longer remissions. MRD testing typically involves highly sensitive techniques like next-generation sequencing (NGS) or flow cytometry on bone marrow samples.
*   **Why is it important?** MRD negativity is an increasing treatment goal, associated with better outcomes.
*   **Your Action:** Discuss MRD testing with your doctor to monitor your treatment progress and understand the implications of the results for your ongoing care.
*   **MRD and Drug Approval:** The FDA, has evaluated minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity as an intermediate endpoint for progression-free and overall survival, culminating in a unanimous vote by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee in April 2024 supporting MRD-negative complete response as an early endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in multiple myeloma that may be used to support accelerated approval.
*   **MRD Negativity Duration**: MRD-negative duration of 3 years corresponded to a 5-year PFS of 66.4%. Longer MRD-negative durations of 4 and 5 years were associated with a significantly increased PFS of 97.9% and 100%, respectively, thus suggesting the additional prognostic value of increasing MRD-negative durations beyond 3 years.

### Key Takeaways:

*   Immunotherapies such as Elranatamab and CAR T-cell therapy provide renewed hope for myeloma treatment.
*   Discuss Elranatamab and CAR T-cell therapy with your doctor if you have relapsed or refractory myeloma.
*   Utilize MRD testing to guide your treatment strategy.

### Monitoring Your Health: Key Metrics

Discuss these metrics with your doctor to track your progress:

*   **M-protein levels:** Reflects myeloma protein levels, indicating disease burden and treatment response.
*   **Serum free light chains:** A sensitive marker for myeloma cell activity, particularly beneficial for light chain myeloma.
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Evaluates the impact of myeloma and treatment on blood cell production (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets).
*   **Kidney function tests:** Monitors kidney health, as myeloma can impair kidney function due to protein accumulation.
*   **Bone marrow biopsy results (including MRD):** Determines the proportion of myeloma cells in the bone marrow and assesses treatment response, including minimal residual disease (MRD).
*   **Imaging results (MRI, PET/CT):** Detects bone lesions caused by myeloma and evaluates the extent and activity of myeloma throughout the body.

### Understanding Your Results:

*   **Improving:** Continue your current treatment and monitoring.
*   **Plateaued:** Discuss strategies to deepen remission with your doctor. Consider consolidation or maintenance therapy, or explore clinical trials involving novel treatment combinations or approaches.
*   **Worsening:** If your disease shows signs of worsening, discuss the next steps with your doctor. This may involve switching therapies, exploring clinical trials, or considering supportive care options to manage symptoms and enhance quality of life. There are always options, and your care team is available to support you.
