# Recent Advances in Multiple Myeloma: What Patients and Families Need to Know

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that makes antibodies. In myeloma, these plasma cells grow out of control in the bone marrow and produce an abnormal antibody called M-protein. This summary highlights recent advancements in myeloma treatment and monitoring, focusing on actionable information to help you and your loved ones make informed decisions.

## Understanding Relapsed and Refractory Myeloma

Many newer therapies are approved for relapsed/refractory myeloma. It's important to understand what these terms mean:

*   **Relapsed myeloma:** The myeloma has returned after a period of remission.
*   **Refractory myeloma:** The myeloma did not respond to initial treatment or stopped responding during treatment.

## 1. New Treatment Approaches & Approvals

*   **Quadruplet Therapy: The New Standard (VRd-Dara)**

    National guidelines favor a four-drug combination called VRd-Dara (also written as Dara-VRd) for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. Eligibility for transplant is generally determined by age and overall health status, but specific criteria should be discussed with your doctor. Daratumumab (Darzalex) *is* FDA approved, but the VRd-Dara regimen *itself* is a guideline-recommended standard of care based on strong clinical trial data. Clinical trials like the Phase 3 GRIFFIN and PERSEUS studies (specifically included newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who were eligible for autologous stem cell transplant) have shown it leads to deeper remissions and longer periods without the myeloma returning (progression-free survival). VRd-Dara is typically given for a set number of cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with lenalidomide until disease progression. Discuss the specific duration with your doctor.

    **VRd-Dara** stands for:

    *   **V:** Bortezomib (Velcade)
    *   **R:** Lenalidomide (Revlimid)
    *   **d:** Dexamethasone (a steroid)
    *   **Dara:** Daratumumab (Darzalex)

    **Common Side Effects:** Cytopenias (low blood cell counts), fatigue, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage, often from Bortezomib), and thromboembolism (blood clots, often from Lenalidomide).

*   **Daratumumab (Darzalex) Added to Standard Treatments**

    Daratumumab (Darzalex) is a monoclonal antibody that helps your immune system target and kill myeloma cells. It's now frequently added to standard chemotherapy regimens to improve their effectiveness. Daratumumab (Darzalex) *is* FDA approved.

    *   Daratumumab (Darzalex) is added to the RVd regimen, resulting in the four-drug combination: Daratumumab + Lenalidomide (Revlimid) + Bortezomib (Velcade) + Dexamethasone
    *   Daratumumab (Darzalex) is added to the VMP regimen, commonly used for older or frail patients, resulting in the combination: Daratumumab (Darzalex) + Melphalan + Prednisone

    An injectable form of daratumumab, **Darzalex Faspro**, is given as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin). Darzalex Faspro subcutaneous injection has been shown to be *non-inferior* in efficacy to intravenous Darzalex, while offering the benefit of shorter administration time.

    **Possible Side Effects:** Common side effects of daratumumab combinations include infusion reactions (less common with Darzalex Faspro), fatigue, and low blood cell counts (cytopenias). Your doctor will monitor you closely for these.

*   **Isatuximab (Sarclisa) Combinations: A Valuable Option for Transplant-Ineligible Patients**

    Isatuximab (Sarclisa) is another monoclonal antibody, similar to daratumumab (Darzalex). It's often used in combination with bortezomib (Velcade), lenalidomide (Revlimid), and dexamethasone (**Isa-VRd**) for patients who are *not* eligible for a stem cell transplant due to age or other health conditions. This provides a highly effective treatment alternative when a transplant isn't an option. Isa-VRd *is* FDA approved for transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed patients. Isa-VRd is typically given for a set number of cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with lenalidomide or isatuximab until disease progression. Discuss the specific duration with your doctor.

    **Possible Side Effects:** Similar to daratumumab (Darzalex), isatuximab (Sarclisa) combinations can cause infusion reactions, fatigue, and low blood cell counts.

*   **Bispecific Antibodies: A New Way to Target Myeloma (Teclistamab)**

    **Teclistamab (Tecvayli™) is a BCMA-directed bispecific antibody that *is* FDA approved specifically for patients with *relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma*.** This means it is used when myeloma has returned after previous treatment or has not responded to prior therapies. **BCMA** stands for B-cell maturation antigen, a protein found on the surface of myeloma cells. Administration of Teclistamab (Tecvayli™) is often done at specialized treatment centers experienced in managing its side effects. These centers utilize safety protocols, potentially including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) programs. Due to the risk of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), Teclistamab (Tecvayli™) is often administered under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program at certified treatment centers. This program ensures that healthcare providers are trained to recognize and manage these potential side effects, and that patients are closely monitored. Most cases of CRS and ICANS are manageable, and severe cases are less common, especially with early intervention. Grading systems are used to assess severity (e.g., grade 1-2 CRS is most common). After the initial weekly dosing, Teclistamab is often given bi-weekly for maintenance, depending on response and tolerability.

    Teclistamab (Tecvayli™) is administered as a subcutaneous injection (under the skin).

    **Important Side Effects:** Teclistamab (Tecvayli™) can cause significant side effects, including:

    *   **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS):** A systemic inflammatory response that can cause fever, low blood pressure, and difficulty breathing.
    *   **Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS):** A neurological complication that can cause confusion, tremors, and seizures.
    *   **Infection risk:** Teclistamab can weaken the immune system, increasing the risk of infections.

    These side effects are usually manageable with prompt treatment, but it's crucial to be aware of them and report any symptoms to your doctor immediately.

*   **Linvoseltamab: Another Bispecific Antibody on the Horizon**

    The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently considering Linvoseltamab for approval. It is also a BCMA-directed bispecific antibody, similar to Teclistamab (Tecvayli™). **Linvoseltamab is currently NOT FDA approved in the United States and remains investigational.** While the FDA is reviewing it, approval is not guaranteed and the therapy is not yet available outside of clinical trials in the US. The review process is ongoing.

*   **Emerging Therapies: Promising Treatments in Development**

    Many new therapies for myeloma are currently being studied in clinical trials. Clinical trials are exploring new treatments at all stages of myeloma. Talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial is an option for you at any point in your myeloma journey. These include:

    *   **CAR-T Cell Therapies:** CAR-T cell therapy *is* FDA approved and is a personalized treatment where a patient's own T-cells (a type of immune cell) are collected, genetically modified in a lab to recognize and attack myeloma cells, and then infused back into the patient. The CAR-T cell therapy process, from cell collection to infusion, typically takes several weeks (e.g., 4-8 weeks). Approved CAR-T products for myeloma include **ciltacabtagene autoleucel (Carvykti)** and **idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma)**, both of which target BCMA. These are specifically approved for *relapsed/refractory* myeloma after multiple prior lines of therapy (check with your doctor for specific eligibility, as the requirements are evolving). The process involves cell collection, modification, and infusion, and often requires a hospital stay.

        **Common Side Effects:** Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) are key concerns, typically managed with supportive care. Longer-term cytopenias (low blood counts) and hypogammaglobulinemia (low antibody levels) can also occur.

    *   **Bispecific Antibodies:** Several other bispecific antibodies are in development, including **Elranatamab**, which is in advanced clinical trials and may become available sooner than some other therapies. Many bispecific antibodies target BCMA, but other targets are also being explored in clinical trials.
    *   **Antibody-Drug Conjugates:** These drugs combine an antibody that targets myeloma cells with a potent chemotherapy drug, delivering the drug directly to the cancer cells. Belantamab mafodotin is an example of an FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in relapsed/refractory myeloma, targeting BCMA.

        **Important Note:** Belantamab mafodotin's main toxicity of concern is ocular (eye) toxicity, requiring a REMS program. Research is ongoing for ADCs targeting other myeloma antigens.
    *   **Novel Small Molecules:** These are new drugs that target specific pathways within myeloma cells to disrupt their growth and survival. Examples include cereblon modulators and selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) compounds like selinexor.

## 2. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Testing: Measuring Treatment Depth

MRD testing is used to measure the amount of myeloma cells remaining in your body after treatment. It's a very sensitive test that can detect even small numbers of cancer cells. MRD testing is highly sensitive, capable of detecting as few as one myeloma cell in a million bone marrow cells (sensitivity of 10<sup>-6</sup>) in some assays. MRD is typically measured from a **bone marrow aspirate** (a sample of bone marrow taken with a needle), although blood-based MRD testing is also emerging. Different methods for MRD testing include next-generation flow cytometry (NGF) or next-generation sequencing (NGS).

*   **Personalized Treatment Strategies:** MRD testing can help your doctor personalize your treatment plan. For example, if you achieve MRD negativity (no detectable myeloma cells) after treatment, your doctor might consider reducing the duration of therapy. If you don't achieve MRD negativity, they might recommend intensifying your treatment or switching to a different therapy.
*   **MRD as a Clinical Trial Endpoint:** In clinical trials, achieving MRD negativity is increasingly being used as a sign that a treatment is effective and may lead to better long-term outcomes.

## 3. Smoldering Myeloma Treatment: Preventing Progression

Smoldering myeloma is an early, non-active stage of myeloma. Patients with smoldering myeloma have abnormal plasma cells in their bone marrow, but they don't have any symptoms or organ damage. Treatment for smoldering myeloma is *not always necessary* and is typically considered for *high-risk* smoldering myeloma to delay or prevent progression to active myeloma. Organ damage in myeloma is defined by the **CRAB** criteria:

*   **C:** Elevated Calcium levels
*   **R:** Renal (kidney) insufficiency
*   **A:** Anemia (low red blood cell count)
*   **B:** Bone lesions (bone damage)

The Phase 3 AQUILA trial suggests that treating smoldering myeloma with daratumumab (Darzalex) might prevent organ damage and delay progression to active myeloma. While Daratumumab is not yet formally FDA-approved for the treatment of smoldering myeloma, studies like the AQUILA trial are showing promise, and it is being investigated in clinical trials and may be considered in certain high-risk smoldering myeloma cases. Daratumumab for smoldering myeloma is investigational and not yet a standard FDA-approved treatment for *all* smoldering myeloma, but is being explored for high-risk cases.

New approaches for *high-risk* smoldering myeloma, such as the triple combination of isatuximab (Sarclisa)/lenalidomide (Revlimid)/dexamethasone, are also being evaluated and may receive FDA approval soon. High-risk smoldering myeloma is defined by specific factors that indicate a higher chance of progressing to active myeloma within a shorter timeframe. Established risk stratification models like the "Mayo 20/2/20 criteria" identify key factors, including M-protein level > 2 g/dL, bone marrow plasma cells > 20%, and involved-to-uninvolved free light chain ratio > 20. Your doctor can assess your risk based on these factors. Discuss with your doctor if you have high-risk smoldering myeloma and whether treatment is appropriate for you. These treatments aim to prevent the disease from becoming active myeloma. It's important to distinguish between treating *smoldering* myeloma to prevent progression versus treating *active* multiple myeloma.

## 4. CAR-T Cell Therapy Advancements: Transforming the Treatment Landscape

Lower rates of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) have been observed when CAR-T is given after a stem cell transplant. This may be related to a less aggressive disease state or the effects of the prior transplant.

## 5. Prognosis Factors: Understanding Your Individual Outlook

Your prognosis (likely outcome) depends on several factors, including:

*   **Performance Status:** Your ability to carry out normal daily tasks.
*   **Stage of Myeloma:** The amount and spread of myeloma in your body, often determined using the Revised International Staging System (**R-ISS**).
*   **Type and Subtype of Myeloma:** This refers to the specific genetic changes (cytogenetic abnormalities) in your myeloma cells and whether you have standard-risk or high-risk myeloma. Genetic testing (cytogenetic analysis or FISH testing) is done on bone marrow samples to identify these risk factors. High-risk genetic changes include del(17p), t(4;14), and t(14;16). Standard-risk genetic changes may include hyperdiploidy and t(11;14).
*   **Blood Test Results:** Abnormal levels of certain substances in your blood can indicate a poorer prognosis. These include:
    *   High beta-2 microglobulin (a protein related to tumor burden)
    *   Low albumin (a protein made by the liver)
    *   High LDH (lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme released when cells are damaged)
    *   High creatinine (a marker of kidney function)
*   **Genetic Changes in Myeloma Cells:** Certain genetic abnormalities, such as **1q21 gain/amp** (an extra copy of part of chromosome 1), are associated with a higher risk of disease progression.

It's important to remember that survival rates are *averages*, and your individual prognosis can vary greatly. Talk to your doctor about your specific situation and how these factors apply to you.

## 6. Understanding Blood Work: Key Indicators of Myeloma Activity

Regular blood tests are essential for monitoring myeloma and assessing your response to treatment. Here are some key tests and what they measure:

*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** This test measures the different types of cells in your blood, including:
    *   **Red Blood Cells (RBC):** These cells carry oxygen. A normal range is typically 4.2 to 5.4 million cells per microliter for men and 3.6 to 5.0 million cells per microliter for women. Low RBC counts can indicate anemia.
    *   **Hemoglobin (Hgb):** This protein in red blood cells carries oxygen. A normal range is typically 14 to 17.5 grams per deciliter for men and 12.3 to 15.3 grams per deciliter for women. Low hemoglobin can also indicate anemia.
    *   **White Blood Cells (WBC):** These cells fight infection. A normal range is typically 4,500 to 11,000 cells per microliter.
    *   **Platelets:** These cells help your blood clot. A normal range is typically 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter.

    Myeloma and its treatments can affect blood cell production in the bone marrow, so CBCs are monitored to ensure counts don't drop to dangerous levels. Keep in mind these are *typical* ranges and can vary slightly between laboratories.

*   **Blood Chemistry and Protein Tests:** These tests measure the levels of different proteins and chemicals in your blood. In myeloma, key things your doctor will look for are:
    *   **M-protein (Monoclonal Protein):** This is an abnormal antibody produced by myeloma cells. It is used to monitor the amount of myeloma in your body.
    *   **Calcium:** Normal range is typically 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL. Elevated levels can occur in myeloma due to bone breakdown.
    *   **Creatinine:** Normal range is typically 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL. Elevated levels can indicate kidney involvement in myeloma.
    *   **Albumin:** Normal range is typically 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL. Low albumin is a negative prognostic factor.
    *   **LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase):** Normal range varies but is typically under 250 U/L. High LDH is a negative prognostic factor.
    *   **Elevated Beta-2 Microglobulin:** This is another protein related to tumor burden and prognosis.

## 7. Patient Support: Resources for You and Your Family

Many organizations offer free support services for myeloma patients and their families:

*   **CancerCare:** [https://www.cancercare.org/](https://www.cancercare.org/) Provides counseling, support groups, and financial assistance.
*   **International Myeloma Foundation (IMF):** [https://www.myeloma.org/](https://www.myeloma.org/) Offers educational resources, support groups, and information about clinical trials.
*   **Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF):** [https://themmrf.org/](https://themmrf.org/) Funds research into new myeloma treatments and provides educational resources for patients.

Patient navigator programs and myeloma mentor programs can also provide personalized guidance and emotional support.

## 8. Other Important Points

*   **Monoclonal Protein Testing: Improved Accuracy with Mass Spectrometry**

    New monoclonal protein testing methods, such as mass spectrometry, are more accurate and sensitive than traditional methods. This allows for earlier detection of myeloma and better monitoring of treatment response. Mass spectrometry can be more sensitive in detecting low levels of M-protein and more specific in identifying the type of M-protein.
*   **Infection Prevention: A Multifaceted Approach**

    Intravenous Immunoglobulin (**IVIG**) is sometimes used to help prevent infections in myeloma patients who have recurrent infections or low antibody levels (hypogammaglobulinemia). IVIG can reduce the risk of serious infections and improve quality of life in these patients. It is not a routine preventative measure for all myeloma patients. Other important infection prevention strategies include vaccinations (e.g., annual flu vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine) and prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., acyclovir for viral prophylaxis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) for PCP prophylaxis in certain high-risk patients) as other measures doctors may recommend.

Cancer treatment is a rapidly evolving field, and the information provided here is based on the latest research at the time of this summary.
